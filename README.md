Under Construction

Rule Type (roughwork for reference):
  Each player has 5 Dice to begin
  The number 1 counts as any number
  First Go: Bid something such as two threes (i.e. that number 6 occurs at least three times amongst all the dice)
  Subsequent turns have three options: 1) Call previous player's bluff, 2) Raise the number count & optionally change the number (three
  twos), 3) Raise the number (only possible if previous bid was on a dice number less than 6).
